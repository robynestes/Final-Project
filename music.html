    <p class="p1">As a music based subculture, trad goth was heavily influenced by many different artists, many of which are still considered influential to fans of goth music to this day. Some of the forefathers of this genre include Bauhaus, Joy Division, The Cure and Siousxie and the Banshees. Bauhaus is commonly considered one of the most influential of these bands, with their first album “In the Flat Field” from 1980 being one of the first gothic rock, or trad goth, albums released. Their single “Bela Lugosi’s Dead” from 1979 is also considered one of the more iconic early gothic rock songs. While music from bands like Joy Division, Bauhaus and Siouxsie and the Banshees can be recognized by their heavy drums, low vocals, and dark lyrics, music from artists like The Cure and the Cocteau Twins are more ethereal in nature, with dreamy lyrics, distorted guitar, and high vocals. Some of the many subgenres of trad goth include gothic rock/batcave, death rock, dark wave, cold wave, minimal wave and ethereal wave.</p>
