    <p call="p1">With the rise of modern technology and social media, goth culture has gone through many changes and many new sub genres have been born in both music, aesthetic and attitude. Modern goths tend to be more aware of issues with political and religious iconography, and making sure those of all ages, races and genders feel included. Representation has come a long way in the trad goth community, with many people of colour often stating that the stereotypically pale skinned goth aesthetic can leave people with darker skin feeling ostracized from the sub culture. Many different artists have been influenced by the artists of the 70’s and 80’s who led the way in goth culture, and new bands such as Twin Tribes, Black Angel and Death Loves Veronica among many others pay tribute to the pioneers of the genre while still making their own unique mark on the genre. Each generation finds a new and exciting way of rejuvenating trad goth and respecting the origins of the culture while also putting their own exciting spin on it, which creates an ever evolving definition of what goth is.</p>
