    <p class="p1">Traditional goth, or “trad goth”, is a music based subculture which rose to popularity in the 1980’s. Taking inspiration from the British post-punk scene in the 1970’s, this subgenre was heavily inspired by goth, punk and dark rock music and the aesthetics that are associated with those genres. Origins of goth as a genre can also be traced back to literature and art, with the works of poets and authors such as Edgar Allen Poe and Bram Stoker influencing the dark and poetic nature of this subculture. Though recognized internationally, much of the physical roots of trad goth developed in the underground British club scenes such as The Batcave, which went on to influence the subculture so much that it lent its name to a music sub-genre. </p>
