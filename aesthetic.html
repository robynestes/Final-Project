    <p class="p1">Very distinctive in appearance, the traditional goth aesthetic is recognizable for its often dark clothing, teased black hair, and pale skin paired with dark and dramatic eye makeup. Goth style has become very popular to imitate, and is often depicted in media and as Halloween costumes every year, yet these fashion, hair and makeup looks are part of an everyday lifestyle for many. Like any aesthetic, each person will have their own style, but many share certain trends, many of which were inspired by goth fashion icons like Siousxie Sioux from Siouxsie and the Banshees. Her unique and bold eye makeup has inspired many over the years. Like punk, the goth fashion style can be a creative blend of materials such as lace, leather and latex, accessorized by large jewelry, fishnet stockings, platform and combat boots, and ripped jean or heavy leather jackets. Political and religious fashion statements were also not uncommon, some artists like Sid Vicious and Siouxsie Sioux even caused controversy by wearing swastikas, yet not as promotion but as a form of protesting Nazi imagery, which many did not agree with. Whether one deems it acceptable or not, some punks and goths have historically used their music and fashion to cause a statement and elicit a reaction, which this certainly did. </p>
